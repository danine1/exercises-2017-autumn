            <h4>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</h4>

            <p>Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense,
                very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped
                onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but
                overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense
                and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday
                night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars
                fan!<br> I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.<br> Maybe it's because
                I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to
                achieve what the other one couldn't.<br> I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough
                for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good
                in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good
                old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move
                , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not
                deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.</p>
