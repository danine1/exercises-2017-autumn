                <p><strong>London, 1969</strong> - two 'resting' (unemployed and unemployable) actors, Withnail and Marwood, fed up with damp, cold, piles of washing-up, mad drug dealers and psychotic Irishmen, decide to leave their squalid Camden flat for an idyllic holiday in the countryside, courtesy of Withnail's uncle Monty's country cottage. But when they get there, it rains non-stop, there's no food, and their basic survival skills turn out to be somewhat limited. Matters are not helped by the arrival of Uncle Monty, who shows an uncomfortably keen interest in Marwood...<br>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>During the film, Danny mentions an acquaintance of his named The Coalman, then threatens Withnail with a potent drug called The Embalmer. Both The Coalman and The Embalmer are the names of two hangover "cures".</p>
                <h3>Goofs</h3>
                <p>When the letter is delivered to the cottage, Withnail picks it up from the table to read it. In the following shot, he is holding the envelope at the back of the letter which wasn't in his hands in the previous shot.</p>
